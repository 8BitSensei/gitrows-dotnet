# Getting Started

## What is GitRows?

GitRows makes it easy to use and store data in GitHub and GitLab repos. You can read data stored in `.csv` and `.json` files from **all public repos** and read, create, update and delete data in **public or private repos** that you have access to, all with the benefit of version control. GitRows also supports basic `.yaml` file operations, mainly for reading and writing [OpenAPI documents](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3).

## Installation

GitRows provides a free REST API to all public repositories on GitHub and GitLab. The API url is always in the format:

```shell
https://api.gitrows.com/@namespace/owner/repository/path/to/file(.json|.csv|.yaml)
```

You can easily convert any file url or check your API Path with the [Linter and Converter Tool](https://gitrows.com/linter).


## Usage

### Basic

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.gitrows.com/@github/gitrows/data/iris.json
